BITTORRENT CLIENT

login : hc121, hs48


1 ) Tracker / Parsing Meta info
    Once client adds a torrent, we parse the torrent file to get tracker url and info dict. We use golang "bencode-go" library to parse bencoded text from tracker server. After we receive port and IP's of all peers, we establish TCP connection with each peers and conduct bittorent handshake. 

    Each Peer Struct in our design has 4 variables, remote/local interested and remote/local choked. All requests are sent if and only if remote choke is set to false and local interest variable is set to true. 

    After conducting handshake with peers, we start a new thread that sends keep alive message every 2 minutes. 
    








2) Downloading 
 - dividing work among peers 




 - choking and unchoking 




 - avoiding already downloaded piece 




 - queue implementation for lower latency  





3) Seeding
